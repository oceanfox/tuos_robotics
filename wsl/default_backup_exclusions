# A list of items to ignore during 'wsl_ros backup'
# List files and folders here to be excluded from the backup
# Items must be quoted relative to the home directory
#   e.g.: /home/student/... (as below)
# We recommend you leave most of these items here alone and 
#   only ADD to the bottom of the list, if necessary.
