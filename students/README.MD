# Automated installer for COM2009 and COM3528 ROS environment

## Description
This part of the repo is for COM2009 and COM3528 students (and anyone else interested), who wishes to install the Robotics Teaching environment on their own computer running Ubuntu 20.04.

## Usage
Download and run the automated script `full_install.sh`, which *should* set everything up for you.
